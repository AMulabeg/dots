# My macOS Setup

Welcome! This is my personal macOS configuration, designed to improve the experience with tools that make window management a breeze. I use **Yabai**, a tiling window manager, to replicate an i3-like setup with identical keybindings. For the bar, Iâ€™ve customized **Sketchybar**, based on Felix Kratz's fork.

Text editing is handled with **Neovim** (in its own repo) and **Tmux**, while **Wezterm** serves as my terminal.
