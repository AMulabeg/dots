# Welcome to my (mostly) macOS setup

Hello there, and welcome to my config. I am not the biggest macOS fan, but my config makes it much more enjoyable. I use Yabai, a tiling window manager that fixes all of the issues that macOS has regarding window management. My setup resembles that of an i3 setup, as the keybindings are identical.
The bar is called Sketchybar, which is highly customizable. My current setup is a fork of Felix Kratz's bar. If you have any questions or need help setting up anything, you can add me on Discord as "_a1mer" and I'll gladly help you.

As for my text editor, I use Neovim and Tmux (Neovim has its own repository).
My terminal is Wezterm
